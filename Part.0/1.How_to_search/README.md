#  How to Efficiently Search for Information

[English](README.md) | [中文](README_zh.md)

### Regarding Searching

**Abandon Baidu, Make Good Use of Google**

When it comes to computer resources, the quality of Chinese resources on the internet is significantly inferior to English resources. Chinese computer resources heavily rely on low-quality blogs copied and pasted from unknown sources on platforms like CSDN, and various scraping/reverse proxy sites often rank higher in search engine results. Therefore, it's recommended to abandon Baidu.

**The English internet, on the other hand, offers a wealth of high-quality content**, including tutorials and feedback threads on various forums. There is a high probability of finding the desired information in English.

Our lab's Wi-Fi already has built-in magical internet access capabilities, but if you need to use Google in the dormitory, you'll need to have your own magical internet access tool.

### Regarding Troubleshooting Errors and Bugs

The original link to "How to Ask Questions The Smart Way" is available here: [How to Ask Questions The Smart Way (zh_CN)](https://github.com/ryanhanwu/How-To-Ask-Questions-The-Smart-Way/blob/main/README-zh_CN.md)

**It is highly recommended to read it!**

To summarize briefly:

- Before asking a question:
  - Carefully read the **official documentation** to check if any steps were missed in the tutorials and if the FAQ addresses your issue.
  - **Google** the problem and **browse through forum threads**; it's highly likely that someone else has encountered the same issue.
  - Avoid asking [questions you shouldn't ask](https://github.com/ryanhanwu/How-To-Ask-Questions-The-Smart-Way/blob/main/README-zh_CN.md#不该问的问题).
- When asking a question:
  - Describe the **operating environment** (hardware configuration, operating system, software version).
  - Describe the **actions taken**, preferably steps that can reproduce the issue.
  - Describe any diagnostic tests/**troubleshooting steps** performed.
  - Explain how you researched and understood the problem before asking the question.
  - Provide error messages and **logs**.

### Some High-Quality Sources of Information

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/): A well-known computer forum that contains various threads discussing difficult and miscellaneous issues.
- [YouTube](https://youtube.com/): Offers high-quality English tutorials.
- [Bilibili](https://bilibili.com/): Provides Chinese tutorials, but personal evaluation suggests it is not as good as YouTube.

### About ChatGPT

Registration and usage require a mobile phone number and IP address from outside mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau.

To be honest, ChatGPT is quite useful as it can help with some fuzzy searches and provide summaries to aid in quickly understanding concepts. However, it often makes errors when dealing with slightly complex concepts. It's advisable to verify the information using Google.
