# Light LED

[English](README.md) | [中文](README_zh.md)

## 1. Configure STM32CubeMX

We can see that the LED is connected to the PC13 pin in the [Circle diagram](../2.New_Empty_Project/attachments/STM32F103C8T6%E6%A0%B8%E5%BF%83%E6%9D%BF%E5%8E%9F%E7%90%86%E5%9B%BE.pdf). So we should set the PC13 pin as GPIO_Output mode.
